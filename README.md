# Electron + Angular CLI + WebSockets

This is starter or sample application I setup to test integrating these three technologies together.

### Global Dependencies

Angular CLI - `npm install -g @angular/cli`

Electron - `npm install -g electron`

### Development work flow.

install dependencies with `npm i`
run application with `npm start`

### Testing sockets

I've found Smart Websocket Client for Chrome to be extremely helpful with testing WebSockets you can get it [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/smart-websocket-client/omalebghpgejjiaoknljcfmglgbpocdp)
